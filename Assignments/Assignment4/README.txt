Some notes:

- Within the main function there are two labelled blocks of code. If you wish to use in-line testing, simply comment out the second block and comment out the second, each block starts with the label "START" and ends with the label "END".

- We have chosen not to print a word twice in the case that the start and end word are the same. In this case, the word is only printed once since that is technically a word ladder between the two with no duplicated words.
